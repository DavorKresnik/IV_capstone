# IV Capstone

The project is an inventory tracker. Its job is to look through the inventory.txt file and pick out functions available to the user:
- add inventory
- view the  inventory
- restock the lowest number of the item
- search for an item
- display the value of items for each location

Currently, the program is only set to run in the terminal, so no installation is needed.
Download the .py with the .txt file and run it in the IDE of your choice.
